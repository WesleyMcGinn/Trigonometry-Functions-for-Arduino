# Trigonometry-Functions-for-Arduino
# NOTE: THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT FINISHED YET.
## About:
#### I noticed that it is sometimes very difficult or impossible to import a good trigonometry library into arduino.  That is why I am making functions that you can copy and paste into your sketch that will allow you to get values from things such as `Cos(47)`, `Sin(272)`, or even `Acos(51)`.  I am using Python to generate some of the C++ code (so that I don't have to type out every trigonometric value for every degree) and then making that code usable.

## How to use:
#### After copying and pasting the code from "FINAL.cpp" into your sketch, you can use the following syntaxes to get values:

Main Functions in Degrees:

`Sin(w) // Returns the sine of w when w is in degrees`

`Cos(w) // Returns the cosine of w when w is in degrees`

`Tan(w) // Returns the tangent of w when w is in degrees`

`i_Sin(w) // Returns the inverse of the sine of w in degrees`

`i_Cos(w) // Returns the inverse of the cosine of w in degrees`

`i_Tan(w) // Returns the inverse of the tangent of w in degrees`

Main Functions in Radians:

`siN(w) // Returns the sine of w when w is in radians`

`coS(w) // Returns the cosine of w when w is in radians`

`taN(w) // Returns the tangent of w when w is in radians`

`i_siN(w) // Returns the inverse of the sine of w in radians`

`i_coS(w) // Returns the inverse of the cosine of w in radians`

`i_taN(w) // Returns the inverse of the tangent of w in radians`




Other trigonometric functions, including cosecant(csc), secant(sec), and cotangent(cot) may be added later on; nevertheless, the main functions are the priority right now.
