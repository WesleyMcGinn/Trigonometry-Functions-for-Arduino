# Trigonometry-Functions-for-Arduino
# NOTE: THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT FINISHED, YET.
## About:
#### I noticed that it is sometimes very difficult or impossible to import a good trigonometry library into arduino.  That is why I am making functions that you can copy and paste into your sketch that will allow you to get values from things such as `Cos(47)`, `Sin(272)`, or even `cot(51)`.  I am using Python to generate some of the C++ code (so that I don't have to type out every trigonometric value for every degree) and then making that code usable.
